Management is an activity found in all organizations, made necessary by
the need to determine the organization’s purpose and future activities,
the nature of its organization and structure, to lead and motivate the
workforce within the organization, and to evaluate and correct its
course, if necessary. The organization accomplishes its purpose in part
through its workforce, the people it employs. If you have just joined
the ranks of management, you may need to quickly obtain hands-on
knowledge for a brisk, successful start to your new position. Our
objective in this course is to provide new supervisors or managers with
just such basic, practical knowledge necessary for their new positions,
such as making the transition to management, leadership, coaching, team
building, communication skills, motivation and empowerment,
organization, efficiency, time management, an appreciation for
diversity, performance management, hiring, termination, discipline,
decision making, and problem solving. The course will begin with a
self-assessment of management skills you already have so you can
identify those you need to develop. Then, one unit at a time, the course
will guide you through all of the topics that are outlined above. By the
end of this course, you should have gained a useful familiarity with
these topics and, in most instances, be able to apply the knowledge
immediately in your work setting. When you have finished the course, you
might want to consider retaking the assessment to see how much you have
learned.

### Course Information

Welcome to PRDV203: Introduction to Management. General information
about this course and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Course Designer: **Victoria Fox  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Wikimedia Commons: Dirk Hünniger’s *[Managing Groups and
    Teams](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Managing_Groups_and_Teams.pdf)*
-   *[Principles of
    Management](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Management.pdf)*

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the materials in each unit. In order to *pass* this course,
you will need to earn a 70% or higher on the Final Exam. Your score on
the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete it. If you do not
pass the exam, you may take it again following a 14-day waiting
period.  
  
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of
approximately **30 hours** to complete. Each unit includes a *time
advisory* that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit. These advisories should help you plan your time
accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at these time advisories
and to determine how much time you have over the next few weeks to
complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For example,
unit 1 should take you approximately 4.75 hours. Perhaps you can sit
down with your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1, 1.2, and
1.3 together (a total of 0.75 hours) on Monday night; and split up
subunit 1.4 (4 hours) over a series of nights.
