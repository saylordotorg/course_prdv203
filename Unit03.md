**Unit 3: Leadership** <span id="3"></span> 
*You have already read that leadership is the third of the four
functions of management. Leadership – the ability to lead, motivate, and
inspire people – is probably considered management’s most important
skill. You may have already exhibited some leadership traits that
factored into your promotion to supervisor.*  
    
 *What is the difference between leadership and motivation? With
leadership, a person exerts influence over people to work toward a
common goal. Inspiration and vision are in a leader’s tool set. On the
other hand, managers achieve employee motivation by understanding the
fit between employees’ needs and the organization’s best interests.
Since motivation is somewhat different in goal and process, we will
discuss it in another unit.*  
    
 *The combination of leadership and motivation helps managers direct
their workforce. The human resource is just one of four resources needed
to run a business, but it can be the most challenging resource to
manage. As a supervisor, you will be in charge of that critical and
important resource: people.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will learn the definitions of* leader*and*
leadership*. You also learn about basic types of leadership that have
been identified and described throughout the centuries, and some that
have only recently arisen. From these styles, you should recognize some
attributes that you possess. You should be able to identify your primary
style and determine how applicable it is to your work situation. From
there, you should be able to adjust your style accordingly to bring
about the results you and your organization seek.*  
    
 *One aspect of leadership involves recognizing when your workload has
become too much and delegating some of the work to your staff. To
optimize your chance of success* *-as well as your subordinates’
success* *-you must empower your subordinates to complete the delegated
tasks. You will learn about delegation in this unit and empowerment in
Unit 10, “Team Building”.*
