**Unit 7: Motivation** <span id="7"></span> 
*Motivation concerns not only business managers, but also coaches and
teachers. In this unit, we will learn the meaning of motivation, and
that money is not always the best motivator for everyone. In the pursuit
of creating employee satisfaction through proper motivation, you will
find that motivation is interlocked with morale. When staff members are
well motivated, morale increases, as does loyalty. On the other hand,
poor understanding of your staff’s motivation can lead to high turnover,
poor attitude, absenteeism, and sloppy work, all of which are indicators
of low morale.*  
    
 *This unit aims to develop a number of motivational tools for your
arsenal. First, you will find that proper job design can increase staff
members’ interest and enthusiasm in their work. You will look at the job
elements and learn to modify them according to your needs and the needs
of your team.*  
  
 *Then, you will learn how goal setting plays a part in motivation. In
this unit, you will learn the SMART technique to set goals at all
levels. Finally, you will study the classic management by objective
theory, another well-known, effective, goal-setting technique.*

**7.1 Motivational Theories** <span id="7.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Principles of Management*: “Chapter 14, Introduction,”
    “Section 1: Need-Based Theories of Motivation,” and “Section 2:
    Process-Based Theories”**
    Link: *[Principles of
    Management](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Management.pdf)*
    (PDF): “Chapter 14, Introduction,” “Section 1: Need-Based Theories
    of Motivation,” and “Section 2: Process-Based Theories”  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 14, “Motivating Employees,” on pages
    531-557. Section 1, “Need-Based Theories of Motivation,” on pages
    532-539 will help you become familiar with need-based motivational
    theories.  
        
     Section 2, “Process-Based Theories,” on pages 540-557, will give
    you the background of several theories that examine motivation as
    influenced by a person’s perception of the working environment
    (equity theory and expectancy theory). This section also includes a
    discussion of the well-known psychological concept called
    reinforcement theory and how it applies to motivating workers.  
        
     Pages 550-554 briefly describe the history of job design, starting
    with job specialization and then moving on to discuss job rotation,
    enlargement, and enrichment. Lastly, the job characteristics model
    looks at five aspects of jobs that influence motivation.  
        
     Pages 554-557 focus on goal-setting theory (SMART). Because
    management sets goals and objectives during the planning process,
    goal-setting theory fits very easily into management practices. This
    is perhaps why goal-setting theory is the most widely used of the
    motivational theories.

     Instructions: Read pages 41-44 for a discussion of team motivation.
    Individual and team motivation are not the same; an individual
    instinctively seeks to fulfill his or her own needs, which may
    conflict with team needs. Yet individual motivation can exert
    considerable influence over team success. This section will show you
    how motivation at the individual and team levels can be brought
    together to foster team success.  
        
     Reading this chapter should take approximately 15 minutes.
