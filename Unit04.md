**Unit 4: Communication, Conflict, and Negotiation** <span
id="4"></span> 
*Good communication skills are essential in all walks of life, and your
workplace is no exception. If anything, a supervisor’s communication
ability will be called upon and tested more frequently than a regular
employee’s.*  
    
 *The field of communication encompasses more than your verbal and
writing skills; it includes understanding both your nonverbal
communication and your staff’s nonverbal cues. It also includes
listening skills, which may prove to be the most critical aspect of
effective interaction with your employees.*  
    
 *Additionally, good communication abilities play a major part in one of
a manager’s most significant tasks: that of managing conflict.
Identifying types of conflict, recognizing positive and negative
conflict, and applying conflict management techniques are part of this
task.*
