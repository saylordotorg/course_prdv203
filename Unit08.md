**Unit 8: Goals, Objectives and Performance Management** <span
id="8"></span> 
*One of a manager’s tasks is to let employees know how well they are
doing their jobs and meeting their company’s goals. This performance
appraisal fills several needs, from informing employees of their
performance to providing human resources with information for future
goals and training needs.*  
    
 *A well-designed appraisal process should consist of more than simply a
two-hour meeting between the supervisor and the employee at the end of
the year. It can take place year-round, enhancing your staff’s
productivity and development continuously. There are several tools for
performance management; when you are done with this unit, you should be
able to determine which of these tools most suit your needs.*

**8.1 What Are Goals and Objectives?** <span id="8.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Principles of Management*: “Chapter 6: Goals and
    Objectives”**
    Link: *[Principles of
    Management](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Management.pdf)*
    (PDF): “Chapter 6: Goals and Objectives”  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 6, “Goals and Objectives,” on pages
    233-276. Note the discussion of the various measurement approaches
    discussed in Section 2, “From Management by Objectives to Balanced
    Scorecard,” on pages 239-245. This section explains the theory
    behind management by objectives, an approach introduced in the
    1950s. Management practice has since evolved to the balanced
    scorecard approach, to which you should pay special attention.  
        
     Pages 248-253 are noteworthy as they can help you set appropriate
    goals and troubleshoot problematic goals and objectives already in
    place.  
        
     Pages 254-261 discuss performance reviews and give advice on your
    own performance review.  
        
     Reading this chapter and taking notes should take approximately 1
    hour and 30 minutes.

    Link: *[Principles of
    Management](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Management.pdf)*
    (PDF): “Chapter 6: Exercises”  
        
     Instructions: Perform the exercises on page 275 at the end of
    Chapter 6 to check your understanding of the balanced scorecard
    approach. Chapter 6, Section 6, “Your Personal Balanced Scorecard,”
    on pages 269-275 of *Principles of Management* provided instruction
    on how to set your personal mission, vision, and strategy; personal
    goals; and key roles. It also taught you how to apply SMART criteria
    to your own situation and suggested activities that will prepare you
    for your management role.  
        
     Answering these questions should take approximately 1 hour.

-   **Optional: Creating Your Personal Balanced Scorecard**
    Instructions: Apply the suggested activities in these pages to a
    particular goal (or set of goals) that you may have had in mind for

    the chance to observe how you are fulfilling the goal(s), obstacles
    that you encountered, and how you handled them. Pages 269-275

    achieve your goals and objectives, both professionally and
    personally.
