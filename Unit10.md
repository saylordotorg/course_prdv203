**Last Words** <span id="10.8"></span> 
*A last word about all that you have learned about management: you have
mastered concepts that should give you a glimpse into the challenges as
well as the satisfaction that can come from being a good manager. Keep
in mind that this is just the beginning! A good manager will keep
abreast of the latest ideas in management. Along with keeping up with
management theory, you will expand your experience and skills as
you* *involve yourself with new team members and coworkers along with
their varied personalities and abilities. Additionally, changes in the
organization, in industry, in technology, and even changes in the
national and global economy will present a wide range of learning
opportunities for you. So, take a moment to congratulate yourself on a
job well done in your Saylor coursework! Then take a page from the
planning function of the P-O-L-C framework: look ahead to the future and
start creating plans and strategies for yourself and your ongoing
education.  
  
 When you are ready, proceed on to the final exam.*
