**Unit 1: Your Personal Journey to a Supervisory Position** <span
id="1"></span> 
*If you are new to management or hoping to achieve a management
position, you may want to acquire a practical understanding of what
management consists of. You also might want to know the management
skills you possess and what skills you may need to acquire. You also may
be wondering just how you are going to achieve the transition from being
one of the coworkers (and possibly friends) to being the boss. Going
from buddy to boss, while a positive change for you, can cause
awkwardness, tension, and isolation with your former colleagues, and
possible political risk within the company.*  
 *Unit 1 covers these topics. Next, it will give you a brief look into
management theory and concepts that should have practical application in
your work. Then, the unit will explain how to make the smoothest
possible transition from coworker to boss, avoiding typical pitfalls.
Lastly, you will complete a self-survey to discover your learning style
and a self-assessment on one aspect of your leadership skills.*
