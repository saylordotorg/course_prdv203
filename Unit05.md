**Unit 5: Decision Making, Brainstorming, Creativity and Problem
Solving** <span id="5"></span> 
*As manager or supervisor, your team will be looking to you to make
decisions and lead them through the process of problem solving. When
analyzing a situation, however, managers’ preconceptions might cloud
their ability to accurately perceive the problem. Furthermore, it is not
uncommon to mistake symptoms for causes. There also may be times when
you must make decisions quickly and under pressure. The information you
have at hand may be incomplete. Yet hesitation or indecisiveness may
cause a situation to worsen for your company and team, possibly
resulting in the loss of confidence in your leadership. In this unit, we
hope to present a number of decision-making and problem-solving
techniques that will help you clarify a situation and its root causes,
generate alternatives, and select one of those alternatives in a timely
fashion.*  
    
 *Creativity is a desirable trait in all endeavors, but we discuss it
here in conjunction with decision making because it is necessary to
produce many alternatives in the decision-making process. Brainstorming
is a particularly well-known technique associated with the generation of
creativity, so we present the two subjects together.*
