**Unit 6: Diversity In the Workplace** <span id="6"></span> 
*A 2009 study done by a University of Illinois sociologist showed that
the companies with the highest levels of diversity reported, on average,
15 times more sales revenue than those with less diverse
staffs.<sup>1</sup> To work effectively with diverse groups of people, a
supervisor seeks to gain understanding of the cultures and backgrounds
of staff members. Diversity was once viewed only as a problem, but
today’s managers view it as an opportunity for greater potential in
creativity and cross-fertilization of ideas from “outside the box.”*  
    
 *In this unit, you will consider your staff and apply the concept of
diversity to them. You will study your perceptions and the realities of
your staff’s various aspects of diversity. After studying how to find
opportunities for creativity and cross-fertilization, you will observe
your workforce to see where such opportunities might lie.*

     Instructions: Review the “Deep- and Surface-Level Diversity”
    section on pages 76-77 to recognize that personality-based (as
    opposed to demographic) diversity also plays a role in team
    cohesion. If you are interested in pursuing this subject further,

-   **Reading: Note:**
    *After reading these two resources, you should take away a
    description of both demographic and deep-level diversity. The first
    reading explains that there are challenges but also rewards for team
    performance in surface or demographic diversity. Although
    demographic diversity is pervasive in our multicultural,
    immigrant-rich society, the second reading will show you that the
    success for team cohesion rests on the deeper-level diversity of
    personality traits.*

id="6.4"></span> 
-   **Activity: Apply Diversity Knowledge to Your Team**
    Instructions: Apply the principles to your team after reading about
    diversity and diversity management. If you are a team member
    preparing for management, imagine how you would do this. Identify
    demographic elements of diversity among your staff. See how you can
    manage these elements for positive impact on your staff’s
    productivity and wellbeing.  
        
     Next, identify deep-level aspects of diversity in your team. (This
    may be easier if you have been with the team for a while, whether as
    a coworker or manager.) Determine whether there is the potential for
    synergy among staff members and how you might achieve this.  
        
     Lastly, list five ways you could promote diversity in your
    organization. How would you control your efforts to make sure that
    they were successful?  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 15 minutes.
